  <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
    <h3>CyberSecurity</h3>
      <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity is defined as the practices that are taken to protect critical IT systems as well as sensitive information from digital threats, such as hacking,
          phishing, scams, etc. As the technological world is constantly evolving every day, so does the risk of attack. Loads of information are being uploaded on the internet,
          which may be prone to unauthorized users performing data breaches to gain access to these information.
        </p>

        <p>Some popular software security risks may include:</p>

        <p><i>Viruses</i> - a type of malicious software that is designed to essentially hijack a series of computer systems by replicating itself and spreading. They often operate by
           acting as a legitimate piece of application when executed will have unexpected and damaging effects to the system, such as corrupting/destroying data, freezing the
           computer, and many more.
        </p>

        <p><i>Ransomware</i> - similar to viruses, ransomware is another type of malicious software designed to hijack computer systems. When a ransomware attack is performed on a system,
           it essentially locks up the files stored in that computer, in order to unlock the files, a “ransom” is required to be paid within a certain time limit or else the files
           will be permanently deleted. In 2021, approximately more than 500 million ransomware attacks were performed, costing around USD$20 billion in damages.
        </p>

        <p><i>Phishing scams</i> - are a way that cybercriminals can steal private, sensitive information (login credentials, banking details, etc.)  from unsuspecting victims.
           Scams of this nature are usually done through emails/messages that pretend to be from a large organization (such as a bank, police, utility companies) to make it more
           believable. It can be easy to identify phishing emails as spelling errors, formatting errors may be present which would not be on a genuine email. If you do not know
           whether an email is real or a scam, the best course of action would be to physically contact the organization who seemingly sent the message in order to confirm with them.
        </p>

        <p><i>Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Attack</i> - is a malicious attempt to disrupt internet traffic, through overwhelming it with networks of Internet-connected machines.
           In real world terms, a DDOS Attack can be comparable to hundreds of cars intentionally causing a traffic jam on a highway. A victim’s IP address can be exposed and targeted by
           a botnet and sends lots of requests to that respective IP, causing the server to crash. A notorious example of a DDOS attack was when an internet alias named “MafiaBoy” brought
           down the biggest websites (Amazon, Yahoo, eBay) in February, 2000. Overall, the attack caused over $1 billion in damages internationally.
        </p>

        <p>Some ways to protect from security risks is to invest in cybersecurity measures such as:</p>

        <p><i>Anti Viruses</i> - such as Windows Defender, Norton Security, McAfee, etc. can help protect your computer against malware by providing real-time protection through constantly
           scanning files stored on the system, and removing any suspicious software.
        </p>

        <p><i>Multi factor authentication</i> - where a user cannot access a certain application/software with just the login credentials alone, they will need multiple other pieces of
           evidence that prove that they are the true owner of that account. This can be done through sending a PIN code to a mobile number or email, asking security questions that only
           the owner will know, or even using an authenticator app such as Google which generates verification codes every few minutes to avoid unauthorized logins.
        </p>

      <h4>What is the likely impact?What is the likely impact?</h4>
        <p>As technology is becoming more and more relevant and integrated into our lives, we can often find ourselves being overly dependent on it, transacting with banks online,
           storing sensitive information (such as login credentials to various sites) in password managers and many more. However, while it may make our lives easier, it can also
           leave our information vulnerable to risks and threats. Therefore, it is important to make cybersecurity one’s top priority when interacting with anything online.
        </p>

        <p>Nowadays, a lack of awareness about the internet is oftentimes the result of data being breached. On average, a single data breach for an organization will cost around
          $3 million, through lost revenue, a negative public reputation, and most importantly, loss of customers’ reliability on the company. This means that cybersecurity is
          something that businesses cannot afford to ignore, and should aim to educate their staff on the matter and implement measures to prevent future attacks.
        </p>

        <p>It is estimated that the average business will invest between 6 to 14% of their yearly IT budget onto cybersecurity, which is around $20M to $50M per year for a large
           scale company. In turn, there is a growing trend in the amount of job positions being created in the cybersecurity industry, as there is an ever increasing need for professionals.
           Paired with most companies willing to spend generously to protect data, many cybersecurity jobs are high-paying, with most positions going above $100k a year.
        </p>
      <h4>How will this affect you? (Florenz Bacting, s3943864)</h4>
        <p>In terms of how cybersecurity will affect my daily life, and those around me, I would say that it will be greatly beneficial to how I interact on the internet. As when it comes to
           our own confidential information, it can be hacked at any moment’s notice, which could be comparable in the same way our house can be robbed at any time. Therefore, quick, decisive
           action needs to be taken in order to protect ourselves. I can invest in measures that help protect the information that I have, usually anti-virus softwares or firewalls that filter
           safe data, suspicious data and malicious data. These significant technological advancements in cybersecurity throughout the years mean that I will be more confident on the internet,
           knowing that there is a lessened risk of threat and attack.
        </p>

        <p>However, I acknowledge that even with powerful applications designed to protect us and our families from cyber attacks, it is good to still understand that there are certain attacks
           that can bypass those said security measures, I must learn to educate myself in other ways to protect myself from digital threats, such as creating a secure password, carefully analyzing
           emails for potential scams and generally being cautious of everything.
        </p>

        <h3>Blockchain/Cryptocurrencies</h3>
          <h4>What does it do</h4>
            <p>Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchains and cryptocurrencies have been quick on the rise to popularity. Since then, many more coins/tokens were made, with
               some popular ones being: Ether (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA) and some branded as “memecoins” such as Dogecoin, which is based on the “Doge” meme circulating back to early 2010s,
               which consists of a Shiba Inu dog accompanied by random text. With many more to come, it is good to understand what they mean for society today, and possible effects it will
               have on our daily lives.
             </p>
             <p>A block is a collection of data/records stored digitally. Hence, a blockchain is a chain of multiple blocks that stores information electronically in a digital format. Blockchains
                are the technology that essentially enable cryptocurrencies to exist. The innovative aspect with blockchains is that they assure the security of a record of data without a need for
                a central clearing authority. They differ from databases in the way the data is structured, blockchains are decentralized and collect data in the form of blocks and link them together.
                On the other hand, databases are often centralized, where a central authority handles the actions in the database and structures their data in the form of tables. While this way can be
                quicker in most cases, it is ultimately more costly and lacks the security that blockchains have.
            </p>

             <p>Cryptocurrency, in its simplest form is digital money that is bought and sold online, no need for traditional paper bills or coins, it is not based on a physical asset such as gold and
                silver, and it doesn’t go through financial institutions like banks. Instead, cryptocurrencies operate in a fully decentralized system that uses blockchain technology to track transactions.
                Some benefits of using cryptocurrency as a payment method is that it is free from any third party interference, which is why crypto transactions never fail. Moreover, it is very easy to
                use it, through signing up for a digital wallet of crypto and start buying and trading straight away. Cryptocurrency can not only be bought but also “mined”. In the context of Bitcoin,
                mining is done by advanced computer systems that try to solve a difficult computational math problem, afterwards, the first computer to solve it will receive the next block of bitcoin.
             </p>

             <p>As of 2020, the global cryptocurrency market is worth at USD$1.44 billion and with the COVID-19 pandemic in place, people stuck at home have found their way onto crypto trading for the
                very first time in hopes of making a fortune at this perilous time period. However, as quickly as an individual can strike gold, it can be as quick to go bankrupt.
            </p>

             <p>A notable cryptocurrency scam that has been trending as of lately are “rug pulls”, which is when a crypto project (usually a coin or token) is heavily promoted/pumped up in value before
                the developers abandon the project and essentially run away with everyone’s money, leaving the coin with little to no value. This type of scam was responsible for over $3 billion lost for
                victims in 2021 according to Chainanalysis, a blockchain platform.
            </p>

             <p>An example of a fairly recent rug pull is the “Squid Game” crypto coin, which is based on the Netflix South Korean TV Series. Using the hype at the time to their advantage, developers of the
               Squid coin rushed to promote their project which in turn soared in value as thousands of investors bought tokens without much thought. The coin was valued at around $2,800 at its peak, an
               increase of 23million percent, but all came crashing down to less than less than 1 cent in a span of a few minutes. Numerous investors lost their hard-earned cash as the project was ditched
               by the developers and ran away with millions of dollars.
             </p>

          <h4>What is the likely impactWhat is the likely impact</h4>
            <p>Cryptocurrency has had a severe impact on global relations and the general economy of the world. It is safe to say that it has steadily established itself as a feasible currency and form of
               investment, but is not ready to be accepted by most people. As of 2022, there are over 15,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, and a little over 100 million people in the world own some form of crypto.
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt that cryptocurrency is widely recognised at a global level and can either pose an opportunity for wealth or a threat for certain companies and even countries. Nine countries
              (Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Oman, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Bangladesh, and China) currently have a complete ban on the use of cryptocurrency, along with 42 others who placed implicit bans on the idea.
              The main reasoning behind this is that, it is said that crypto can be used in a variety of illegal ways such as: money laundering, fraud, drug trafficking, human trafficking, child exploitation,
              and funding criminal organisations. Criminals favor crypto over other forms of payment because while transactions on the blockchain are public record, the identities of those people who make the
              transaction remain unknown and therefore harder to track by government authorities.
            </p>

            <p>However, putting aside the possible drawbacks of cryptocurrency, the benefits far outweigh them. Blockchain technology has proven to improve economies in a number of ways according to Pelicoin.com:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Blockchain has improved financial institutions’ cross-border transactions.</li>
              <li>Cloud computing can use Blockchain to execute smart contracts and resist hacking.</li>
              <li>Government and public records can use Blockchain to reduce paperwork and fraud while increasing accountability.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All in all, cryptocurrency generally has had a positive impact globally, allowing everyone regardless of situation to
               freely trade internationally, thus creating an “economic equality”.
            </p>

          <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>In terms of how the vast world of cryptocurrency will affect my daily life, I would say it would not affect me at all. I have gotten into trading crypto around the start of 2021, starting off with
               serious projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, making small profits through day trading. I eventually found some projects that were classified as memecoins, a cryptocurrency that has no discernable
               purpose.
            </p>

            <p>Most notably, Dogecoin, after noticing all the hype around this coin on Twitter, I decided to invest some of my “throw-away” (around $200 AUD) money for fun. In April of 2021, thanks to hype from
               Tesla founder, Elon Musk, the price of Dogecoin surged 400% in just one week. At the time, making it top 5 for highest-valued cryptocurrencies. A little over a month later, the coin passed the 50c
               mark, which marks over a 20,000% increase in just one year.
            </p>

            <p>On May 8, 2021, before Elon Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) a lot of hype once again grew for the coin, that is when I sold over $3900 worth of my previously bought Dogecoin just before
               the drop in value, where it dropped 34% from 70c at the start of the show to just below 40c the following morning, a total drop of 45% and $35 billion in lost value. After that encounter, I quickly
               realized how volatile cryptocurrency really is, how it can make you a millionaire in mere moments, but can also all come crashing down due to greed. As of 2022, I have no current investments in cryptocurrency
               but am also aware that it is the future, and will eventually need to prepare for a world dominated by it.
