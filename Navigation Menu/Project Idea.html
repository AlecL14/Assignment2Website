  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>DRIVN® is a software application developed by “The Heard” that is designed to provide shoppers with extremely fast same-day delivery from certain
         shops which can be categorized by location (such as Highpoint, Chadstone, Pacific Werribee) The application will allow customers to place orders from a
         variety of shops in certain shopping centers and the application will designate a driver to pick-up those certain items and deliver it to the customer
         straight away. Ultimately, the goal of this application is to provide individuals who may not have access to transportation the freedom to shop as if
         they were in the mall themselves, as items ordered will be received almost instantly. Moreover, it enables small businesses to be discovered as their
         shop will be seen on the app, essentially giving them exposure to a wider range of potential customers.

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>The motivation behind this project idea is mainly a result of trying to create a faster, more efficient way to order items without needing to order
         it internationally. Through customers ordering from local businesses, the economy is stimulated. Thus, new jobs are created and the close community
         gains revenue, as the money is going straight back into the community’s pocket. Economic prosperity among local businesses means a higher standard
         of living for the wider society, as taxes go back to improving public services among the community.The motivation behind this project idea is mainly a

      <p>Additionally, by choosing to buy locally, this means that there is a reduced carbon footprint (the total amount of greenhouse gasses that are generated
         by our actions) as energy required to transport goods often uses fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. They also release carbon dioxide into the earth’s
         atmosphere, which can contribute to global warming.
      </p>

      <p>Buying locally have positive side effects such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Less cardboard use as compared to international shipping.</li>
        <li>Reduced use of fuel (either from aircraft or ships).</li>
      </ul>
