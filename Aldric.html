<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
<p>Being a logician can be helpful in certain situations as they are very practical minded individuals that focus on completing tasks themselves
<br>if a task is required to be completed. Being analytical as well can be beneficial as they are able to point out the strengths and weaknesses
<br>of certain things which can help in improving group productivity.
</p>

<h3>Big Five Personality Trait</h3>
<p>In this test, having a high score percentile in emotional stability can be very applicable to the team as I am able to help the group keep a
<br>clear goal and stay calm. Not only that but a semi-high score percentile in conscientiousness can be useful as I am an individual that likes
<br>to complete a task or assignment to the best of my ability, which can reflect onto other group members to do so as well.
</p>

<h3>Learning Styles</h3>
<p>Having a pragmatist style means I can be straightforward with the team in communicating and doing certain tasks. However its usability is that
<br>I can be experimental and willing to try out new ways to complete tasks.
