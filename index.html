            <h3>Aldric Xavier Lim</h3>

            <p>My name is Aldric Xavier Malanog Lim (or Alec), my student number is s3949508. I'm a first-year student at RMIT University currently studying a
            Bachelor's of Information Technology. In my pastime, I like to play video games, watch TV series and sports such as the NBA, and also playing
            basketball. My interest in IT is the idea that you can utilise a computer to build and develop many different types of applications through
            programming. Which leads to my interest in IT happening when I found out what my dad's job was but also being around various types of technology
            growing up, pushing me to become curious as to how these technologies worked. My IT experience involves a one-week work placement (Willis Towers Watson)
            where I was working within the IT department inputting data into a broking application, I was also able to learn about their servers and how they maintain it.
