    <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
    <p>According to the 16 personalities website, logicians are always thinking and often “lose themselves in thought”, ever constantly wondering
      about the mysteries of life. As a logician, working in teams may not look like an easy feat, however “they often do their best work in collaboration
      with other people.” Taking in strengths such as having the ability to look at things in a very analytical way can help improve both myself and the
      group as a whole. In addition, the capability of being open-minded can also assist in brainstorming innovative ideas that can greatly support the
      outcome of the project in question.

    <h3>Honey and Mumford Learning Styles</h3>
    <p>Reflectors  learn through critical observation. Very thoughtful and passive when it comes to general discussions, considering all points made
       before offering one’s own views. I can convert the various advantages of being a reflector into great teamwork in a group project. Using strengths
       such as observing the playing field before jumping in, I can confidently come up with ideas that can work in favor of the project at hand and disregard
       other ideas that may not be so great.
    </p>

    <h3>Extroversion Introversion Test</h3>
    <p>According to the results I am sort of in the middle of being an extrovert and introvert. Mutually enjoy being with large and small groups of people.
       In essence, I have built a balance “between actively involving myself in a large social network, and spending some quality time with a few intimate
       friends.” In terms of the consequence of this in teamwork, I strongly believe that it is advantageous, because while I may not always be the
       conversation-starter, it does not mean that I cannot be outgoing, still having the ability to effectively collaborate when needed and contribute
       appreciable ideas with the group.
