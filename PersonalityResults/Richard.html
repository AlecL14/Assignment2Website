<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
<p>Being extroverted and intuitive being my main storing pints, im able to help the team to convey the group project to everyone in a manner thats
   coherent and loud allowing others to understand and engage into our work. Another asset that it can bring onto the team is that itll allow me to bring
   everyone together when we are working on the project in person and lead the group in what we are suppose to be doing or whatnot.
</p>

<h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>
<p>As I am a ‘visual leaner’ based off the learning test, im able to work on statistics and graphs upon the group work as a result am able to generate
   quick ideas and create detailed and efficient forms of explanations based off the graphs or imagery posed upon me.
</p>

<h3>Situational Test</h3>
<p>As a result im above the 50% score for the situational test, im able to compose myself when in a difficult or stressful situation, this will be useful
   when presenting the project in a stage environment as i will not be scared to speak upon the project. Another way this can help is when everyone in the
   group is stress im able to lift up the moral and keep the group focused.
