        <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>

        <p>These results may cause me to be less likely to ask for assistance or feedback when working, but I may also be able to understand and take in ideas
           from others more easily. Taking this into consideration when forming a team I think I would work best with someone who is willing to take leadership
           and organise a group
        </p>

        <h3>Big Five Personality Trait</h3>
        <p>In a team situation, some of these traits indicate that I am a reliable and conscious team player who can bring intellectual and an easy going attitude
           to the team roles. When forming a team, I would prefer team members who are focused on the goal and are more practical in their workplace objectives.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
        <p>My results are a “Visual Learner”. When forming a team, these results should be taken into account by allowing me to work with both others who are placed
           in the other learning style categories and people who are also visual learners. This will allow for both different viewpoints and similar ones in order to
           gain a better understanding of how they would suite the goals of the project
        </p>
