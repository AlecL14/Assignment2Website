        <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>

        <p>Being a logician can be helpful in certain situations as they are very practical minded individuals that focus on completing tasks themselves
           if a task is required to be completed. Being analytical as well can be beneficial as they are able to point out the strengths and weaknesses
           of certain things which can help in improving group productivity.
        </p>

        <h3>Big Five Personality Trait</h3>
        <p> In this test, having a high score percentile in emotional stability can be very applicable to the team as I am able to help the group keep a
            clear goal and stay calm. Not only that but a semi-high score percentile in conscientiousness can be useful as I am an individual that likes
            to complete a task or assignment to the best of my ability, which can reflect onto other group members to do so as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Styles</h3>

        <p>Having a pragmatist style means I can be straightforward with the team in communicating and doing certain tasks. However its usability is that
           I can be experimental and willing to try out new ways to complete tasks.
