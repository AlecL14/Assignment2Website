<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
<p>The results from the Myers-Briggs test indicate that I am by far more turbulent than I am assertive. I see this as a negative, especially in a
   group scenario as it often means that I lack leadership skills and often don’t have as much of an impact in pushing the group in a certain direction.
   It’s important to have members in my team that portray the traits that are somewhat absent from myself.

<h3>Big Five Personality Trait</h3>
<p>Out of all the tests, the big five personality test is one that will be most useful to use when in a group scenario. This test suggests that I am possess
   more conscientiousness and am emotionally stable. This suggests I am a hard worker who is able to work under pressure – an important trait to have,
   especially when working in a group.
</p>

<h3>Learning Styles</h3>
<p>This test tells me that I am mostly a reflector and theorist style learner. I learn by observing actions of others and by reading into topics to better
   understand them. In a team environment, I will learn better by watching my peers perform tasks which can be accompanied with extra reading if necessary.
