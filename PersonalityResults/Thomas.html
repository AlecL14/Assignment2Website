        <h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>

        <p>
            The results from the Myers-Briggs test indicate that I am by far more turbulent than I am assertive. I see this as a negative, especially in a
           group scenario as it often means that I lack leadership skills and often don’t have as much of an impact in pushing the group in a certain direction.
           It's important to have members in my team that portray the traits that are somewhat absent from myself.
        </p>

        <h3>Big Five Personality Trait</h3>
        <p>
            Out of all the tests, the big five personality test is one that will be most useful to use when in a group scenario. This test suggests that I am possess
           more conscientiousness and am emotionally stable. This suggests I am a hard worker who is able to work under pressure – an important trait to have,
           especially when working in a group.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
        <p>
            This test tells me that I am mostly a reflector and theorist style learner. I learn by observing actions of others and by reading into topics to better
           understand them. In a team environment, I will learn better by watching my peers perform tasks which can be accompanied with extra reading if necessary.
