<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
<p>These results show me that I tend to be more Introverted than extraverted and use my feelings to make decisions more than I use
<br>thinking for decisions. They show that I am highly observant, meaning that I am practical and focus more on the present rather
<br>than worrying about the future. These results show me that I use my feelings to make decisions more than I use thinking for decisions.
<br>They show that I tend to not just rush headfirst into a problem but stay back to observe and understand the issue first before creating
<br>a strategy. They also determine that I am a friendly person and highly optimistic.
</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h3>
<p>These results show that I would be useful in a group as I would prefer to plan out the strategies needed to tackle the issues we face.
<br>I would also be able to communicate well with the team and maintain healthy relationships with each of the members with a friendly attitude.
<br>However, according to the Adventurer personality I might display extreme competitiveness which can be harmful for a team.  The ideas I provide
<br>to the team would be more conventional which may not always be the best way to tackle something.
</p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>I should be focused on things like making sure all team members' ideas are heard and thoroughly discussed before the group comes to a decision.
<br>To prevent the trait of being extremely competitive I should keep in mind the main goal of the group which is to complete the assignment and
<br>recognize that everyone functioning together in unity provides the best result. I should also make sure all group members share their ideas so
<br>we can use some abstract ones during the project.
